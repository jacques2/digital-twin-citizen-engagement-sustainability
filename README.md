##  Abstract

The interaction between technology and environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly central in modern urban strategies. Among emerging technologies, **Digital Twins** enable the creation of dynamic virtual representations of physical systems, supporting real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization.  

At the same time, **Citizen Engagement** emphasizes the active involvement of citizens in decision-making processes, fostering transparency, co-design, and long-term sustainability of public initiatives.

This thesis analyzes:

- The concept and evolution of **Citizen Engagement** in environmental contexts  
- The foundations and applications of **Digital Twin** technology  
- The integration of Digital Twins with participatory approaches  
- Real-world **case studies** in smart cities and environmental management  

The work highlights opportunities, limitations, and future challenges of combining Digital Twins and citizen-centered approaches to support sustainable development.
